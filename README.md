# Seeder (entropy) for Magisk

This module is for Magisk 13.1 + v4 template.

This mod give more entropy, for better and smoth runing, with no lag.

After install go to console type "su" then "entro" 

I test it on Galaxy S8+ sdk 23 (7.0) and Note Pro 12.2 sdk 20 (5.0)

Stock entropy was +-400 now is +-4000

Module also stop working when screen is off.
