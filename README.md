# Seeder (Max Entropy) for Magisk

This module is for Magisk 13.1+ v4 template.

This module give You more entropy, for better smoth runing, with no lags.

After install go to console type "su" then "entro"  for see how works.

I test it on Galaxy S8+ sdk24 (7.0) and Note Pro 12.2 sdk20 (5.0)

Stock entropy was +-400 now is +-4000

Seeder also stop working when screen is off, and auto turn On, when screen is On.

Regards
